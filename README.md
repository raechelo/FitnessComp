# FitnessComp

Fitness Comp was the outcome of a UI/UX Challenge given to developers to test their skills at recreating a static comp in a wildly short amount of time. Additionally, we were to act as if we were given solely this comp from a designer in an attempt to recreate a real-world project.

## Stack Used
Back to basics!
 - HTML
 - CSS

## Learning Goals

Refamiliarize ourselves with the building of a static comp, especially under a massive time constraint. We attempted to use as much semantic HTML as possible during the build.
